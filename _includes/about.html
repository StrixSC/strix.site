<p>
  <i>TL;DR</i> : Software engineering student by day, infoSec and machine learning enthusiast by night!
  <br><br>
  I am a software engineering student at the University of Polytechnique Montreal looking for an internship in the field of information security or machine learning.
  Always striving to learn new technologies and adventure myself deeper into the world of knowledge. 
  <br><br>
  I have studied both the Comptia Security+ and the Network+ certifications and am currently working towards getting my CISSP certification aswell. I have experience with numerous CTFs which have helped me understand a lot about common vulnerabilities, with my speciality being Web Challenges. 
  <br>The large amounts of workshops as well as conferences that I've attended in the field of cybersecurity also helped! ðŸ˜…
  <br><br>
  Finally, through personal projects I have managed to learn a lot about the vaste world of artificial intelligence, about the numerous technologies that are available nowadays for web-development for both front-end and back-end and finally develop my problem-solving skills."
